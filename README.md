# Deconfound Prototype

This is a pretty simple prototype of Deconfound, a student-run Q&A site. It's
built on top of [Ruby on Rails][ror] so you'll need that installed to run it.

With Rails installed, simply run the following commands

	bundle install
	rake db:migrate
	rails server

[ror]: http://rubyonrails.org/
